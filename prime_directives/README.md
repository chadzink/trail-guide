# Agile Manifesto
- [www.agilealliance.org](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/)

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
