============
1. Structure
============
A. Use the current, common best practices for the bootstrap grid structure when setting the markup. http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid
  
B. Customize the grid if necessary as far as maximum widths, or margins, etc. Most of the time keep the the standard margins at 15px for containers, but depending on the project, you can set them at 20px.

C. Typography: For wildland projects, Google Fonts will be used as much as possible, using their API to pull in fonts.

2. Files
========
A. Scaffolding/Framework: Bootstrap. Download Bootstrap theme at Go to http://getbootstrap.com/customize/ and customize the bootstrap download according to the client's brand standards. This includes the colors for buttons and links.

B. Colours: flat. No gradients. Keep bootstrap standard colors and styles for alerts.

D. If no standards exist, see Creative Director (herb@wild.land) to establish a base.

E. Download entire set of files for Distribution. This includes .less, img, .js. Any files not used can be omitted by Dev later if necessary.
