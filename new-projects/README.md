# New Projects

## Project Initialization
*New project initialization should be done with the client and the project manager at Wildland*

#### Project Description
This should be a short or long description of the project that answers some of the questions:
1) Who are the users?
   * Is this used by the client?
   * Is this used by client customers?
2) What is the basic business task(s)?
3) Are there any known inputs?
4) What is the expected output?

#### Value Proposition
If possible, describe or diagram out the quantifiable value does this project is expected to add to the client?
1) Increase in sales
2) Process improvement
   * Current task time
   * Expected task time with project
3) Scaling an existing process
   * Current scale achievable
   * Expected scale with project
4) Selling software package (subscription/one-time)
   * Annual sales expectation
   * Distribution

#### Existing or New Solution
Is this a new solution, an upgrade, or improvement? For upgrades and improvements, a list of affected system should be collected.

#### Identify Core Technologies
Need to identify the core technologies that are expected to be used for the project.
1) User Interface (Front-end)
2) Processing and/or Calculations (Back-end)
3) Data Storage (Database or Files)
4) Environment
   * Operating system?
   * Platform as a Service?
   * Other important software/technologies used

#### Identify Milestones/Stages
In general identify any stages of the project.

For example:
1) Design Font-end
2) Database Design
3) Build Core Data Entry
4) Add Reporting
5) Build Data Analytics Interface
5) Add Exporting

or

1) Phase I: New Shipping Module
2) Phase II: Add Item Tracking Module
3) Phase III: Testing & QA

#### Estimate Project Size
*In generalized term, how big is the project*

* Very Small project, expected to take 2 or 3 DAYS
* Small project, expected to take a WEEK or less
* Medium project, expected to take more than a WEEK and less than a MONTH
* Large project, expected to take more than a MONTH
* Very Large project, expected to take more than 3 MONTHS

#### Agree on Deadlines
Lastly we need to have the client understand and agree on rough estimates on deadlines. It is important to set achievable expectations and understand their own goals and timelines.

The final project schedule and timelines cannot be completed until after the "Master Story List" is completed and sized. Therefore, there should be lots or room in these timelines for changes.
