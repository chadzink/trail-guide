# Getting Work Done
General Tips
- Finish your ideas before moving to the next thing. 
 - An idea is finished if it is possible for anyone else is able to continue where you left off.
 - Before you take any breaks or leave for the day leave your work in a finished state.
- Allow yourself the freedom to make mistakes.
 - Use revision control and backups to let you undo things that don't turn out the way you inteneded.
- Define your goal(s) before starting a task so you know when you are finished.
 - A defined goal is one that is clear enough that anyone else can verify if you have reached it or not.
- Seek help often.
 - A good rule of thumb is to seek help if you spend more than 10 minutes without making any progress.
 - An alternative if no one around is to explain what you are doing to the kaleidobear.
- Minimize idle time.
 - If you are unsure of what you should be doing, ask on Slack.

# Daily Workflow
## Standup Meeting
Every weekday there will be a standup meeting that can be attended remotely on [talky.io](beta.talky.io/wildland). Everyone will get a chance to answer the following questions and give any addition information to everyone.
### Questions
- What are you currently working on? 
- And do you know where your current milestone is? 
- How long until you complete that milestone?
- Have you ran any into any blockers? 
- Do you need help?
- Do you need any additional resources?

## Figuring out what to do when no one is around
1. If you have unfinished work from the previous day, start with that.
1. Start on a new issue for any projects you are working on.
 - Pick issues that are unassigned and part of the current milestone.
1. Work on some internal projects.
