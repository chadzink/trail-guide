# Getting Communication Done

# Standup Meeting
Every weekday there will be a standup meeting that can be attended remotly on [talky.io](beta.talky.io/wildland). Everyone will get a chance to answer the following questions and give any addition information to everyone.
## Questions
- What are you currently working on? 
- And do you know where your current milestone is? 
- How long till you complete that milestone?
- Have you ran any into any blockers? 
- Do you need help?
- Do you need any additional resources?

# Working with code
- Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs, which
  you prefer, and reach a resolution quickly. 
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification.
- Avoid selective ownership of code. 
 - Examples: "mine", "not mine", "yours"
- Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits.
 - Examples: "dumb", "stupid"
- Be explicit. Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.

# Having your code reviewed
- Be grateful for the reviewer's suggestions. 
 - Example: _Good call. I'll make that change._
- Don't take comments or critiques personally. The review is of the code, not you.
- Explain why the code exists. 
 - Example: _It's like that because of these reasons. Would it be more clear if I rename this class/file/method/variable?_
- Try to respond to every comment.

# Reviewing someone elses code
- Understand why the code is necessary by reading the relevent issue.
- Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem.
- Seek to understand the author's perspective.
