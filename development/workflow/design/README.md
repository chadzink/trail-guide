# Design at Wildland

## Bootstrap Styles
We use bootstrap classes as much as possible to keep css across apps consistent. This makes it easy for us to use the same tools, and modular bits and pieces, across multiple applications.

## Custom Styles
Occasionally we will need to create custom classes. As a team we should agree on those classes and make sure they are documented.
