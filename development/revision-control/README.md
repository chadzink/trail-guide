#	Revision Control

## GitHub
- Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your
  development machine or process.
- Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.
- Perform work in a feature branch.
- Use a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for code reviews.

### Best Practices

#### Creating Issues
Each repository should have an Issue Template file in the `.github` folder named `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
Please fill out this template as best as you can, if something does not apply, indicate it with N/A, zero, or similar.

#### Creating Branches
There are two primary types of branches 1) issue branch and 2) feature branch.

1. Issue branches are designed to be pulled into the `master` branch or a
   feature branch. They should be named similar to `issue-<###>-<abbreviated>-<tile>-<dash>-<separated>`.
2. Feature branches are designed to have issue branches merged into them. They
   should be named similar to `<abbreviated>-<feature>-<title>-<dash>-<separated>`.
